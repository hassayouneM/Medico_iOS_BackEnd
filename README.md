# Medico_iOS_BackEnd

This project is an application skeleton for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) mobile app.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/hassayouneM/Medico_iOS_BackEnd
```

and install the dependencies

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

A number of node.js tools is necessary to initialize and test the project. You must have node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/). The tools/modules used in this project are listed in package.json and include express, mongodb and mongoose.

#### MongoDB

The project uses MongoDB as a database. If you are on Mac and using Homebrew package manager the installation is as simple as `brew install mongodb`.

### Start the MongoDB server

First we need to create the `db` directory where the database files will live in. In your terminal navigate to the `root` of your system by doing `cd ..` until you reach the top directory. You can create the directory by running `sudo mkdir -p /data/db`. Now open a different tab in your terminal and run `mongod` to start the Mongo server.

### Run the Application

The project is preconfigured with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start this server is:

    npm start
